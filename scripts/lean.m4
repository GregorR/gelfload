# These macros make auto* tests faster by removing some of autoconf's most
# absurd defaults. The basic principle is to not check for things that have no
# alternatives. That is, don't perform a test if it's either going to pass and
# affect nothing, or fail and just prevent you from building. These tests
# provide very little real value since modern systems that they fail on are few
# and far between.


# automake's sanity checks provide nothing useful, since all they can do is
# fail, sometimes spuriously, and prevent builds which may otherwise have
# succeeded.
